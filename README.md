This allows you to view markdown files online as a presentation in Reveal.js

To use this, go to `https://patarapolw.github.io/reveal-md/#<YOUR_URL_HERE>`

You can also edit in Visual Studio Code using <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evilz.vscode-reveal>

### Tips

- You can edit the CSS using the inline CSS, for example

```html
<style>img { max-height: 500px !important; }</style>
<style>li { font-size: 30px; }</style>
```

---

To make the result local, try

```html
<!-- .slide: class="slideName" -->
<style>.slideName img { max-height: 500px !important; }</style>
```
